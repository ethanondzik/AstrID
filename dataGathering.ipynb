    "The `getStarData` function is a crucial part of our data preparation pipeline. It is responsible for generating and saving FITS files that contain both image data and star catalog data. These FITS files are then used to train our model. Below, we explain the functionality of the `getStarData` function and how it is used to prepare the dataset for training and validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `getStarData` function performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directory Creation**:\n",
    "   - Creates a new directory named `data` if it does not already exist. This directory will store the generated FITS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coordinate Generation**:\n",
    "   - Generates random coordinates (RA and Dec) while avoiding the galactic plane to ensure a diverse set of sky regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Image Data Fetching**:\n",
    "   - Uses the `SkyView` service to fetch image data from the DSS survey for the generated coordinates. The image data is saved as a FITS file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Star Catalog Fetching**:\n",
    "   - Uses the `Vizier` service to fetch star catalog data for the same coordinates. The star catalog data is appended to the FITS file as a binary table HDU.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pixel Mask Creation**:\n",
    "   - Creates a pixel mask indicating the positions of stars in the image. The pixel mask is saved as an additional HDU in the FITS file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Star Overlay Plot**:\n",
    "   - Generates a plot of the image with star positions overlaid. This plot is saved as an image file and then converted to FITS format, appended to the original FITS file.\n"
