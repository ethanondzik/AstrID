The UI uses the Dash framework to illustrate the differences between the true labels
of the data, white pixels (bright cosmic objects) in this case, and the predicted location of said objects.

The intent to show how far off or close predictions may look like using a generic coordinate system.

To run the Presentation.py locally if using a Unix based terminal and python3, type:

    - python3 -m venv .dash_ui
        To create your own virtual environment called "dash_ui"
    
    - source .dash_ui/bin/activate
        To activate the virtual environment

    - pip install -r requirements.txt
        Wait for dependencies to download

    - python3 Presentation.py
        Copy and paste the HTTP URL provided by the output then paste it on your browser

You can then toggle the items on the graph on/off by clicking on the legend on the right side of the screen.
Feel free to explore the other features of the UI by yourself.
